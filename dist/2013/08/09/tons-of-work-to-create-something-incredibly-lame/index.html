They&#39;ve released the second of the promotional spots, and I&#39;m sad to say that not only aren&#39;t they something I want to put out there to show people what&#39;s interesting about go, I find them a little embarrassing.</p>
<p>Important note: I&#39;m a bit embarrassed to be complaining about this at all. You know how much effort and enterprise it took to make these things? You know how much effort and enterprise I&#39;ve shown in <em>anything</em> my entire life? But I&#39;m doing it anyway because I&#39;m an asshole.</p>
<p>They&#39;re shockingly generic and if I had to sum up what they&#39;ve communicated so far about go, it&#39;d be: &quot;Go. Cool, I guess? Fun to do while drinking wine?&quot;</p>
<p>The stories seem like they were created by someone who had &quot;Go: cool / fun&quot; written on a yellow index card, actually.</p>
<p>And it depresses me, not because it&#39;s so horrible to fail at something very difficult (you want _me_ to write a better promo spot? umm, er...) but because it&#39;s depressing how completely dependent all of the work of hiring actors, lighting sets, recording, and editing is on a <em>good script</em>. When I watch bad animated movies, for instance, my heart almost stops when I imagine the tens of thousands of man hours that were tossed down the hole of a half-baked, patronizing script.</p>
<p>Enough complaining. If you haven&#39;t seen them already, check out the two spots and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>h2. Update</p>
<p>As I mentioned in a comment on this post, I showed these to my wife and she loved them. There are few people whose taste I share as much as I do hers, so I found this jarring.</p>
