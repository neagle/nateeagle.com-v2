One of my favorite things is to look at games with comments on them, either pro games with commentary from strong players (like those at &quot;Go Game Guru&quot;:<a href="http://gogameguru.com/)">http://gogameguru.com/)</a>, amateur games with commentary from teachers (like &quot;those from my teacher&quot;:<a href="http://zhouyuan.com/teachingsample.html">http://zhouyuan.com/teachingsample.html</a>, Yuan Zhou), or games by players around my strength working through the same kinds of issues I am, like my longtime friend and go rival, &quot;Ben Hong&quot;:<a href="http://bengozen.com/">http://bengozen.com/</a>.</p>
<p>The best option out there right now for displaying game records on a webpage is &quot;Eidogo&quot;:<a href="http://eidogo.com/">http://eidogo.com/</a>, created by Justin Kramer. I can&#39;t say enough in praise of Kramer&#39;s work: it&#39;s JavaScript-driven and the primary renderer is html and css. It does a lot more than display game records; its joseki tutor and pro game pattern search are remarkable. More than that, Kramer&#39;s source code is clean, well-formatted, and well-commented. It&#39;s a pleasure to browse through his JavaScript on Github.</p>
<p>But Eidogo lacks some things I&#39;d really like out of an SGF viewer. It doesn&#39;t respond to the width of the container it&#39;s placed in, which means it doesn&#39;t always look great on mobile devices, and it&#39;s almost always in its narrow form when embedded on sites, which leaves too small an area for extended comments, in my opinion. Then there&#39;s the feature I want most of all: the ability to allow others to comment on individual moves. You can usually comment on the post that a game in is embedded in, but that forces awkward descriptions like, &quot;That extension in move 56 seems slow for white...&quot; I&#39;d like to allow discussions to arise around the moves themselves, as if readers were able to asynchronously join in a review of the game itself.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t blame Eidogo for any of this: Kramer developed Eidogo years ago, and with his own priorities. But it led me to try to create my own. I put off the project after a couple aborted starts: I&#39;m not the programmer Kramer is, and I got stuck just writing a parser to translate SGF files (a text format created by &quot;Anders Kierulf&quot;:<a href="http://www.smartgo.com/anders.htm">http://www.smartgo.com/anders.htm</a>) into JavaScript. But the wonderful thing about my job is that I get paid to learn more about programming, so when I sat down recently to &quot;try my luck again&quot;:<a href="https://github.com/neagle/gokibitz/blob/master/src/js/sgf.js">https://github.com/neagle/gokibitz/blob/master/src/js/sgf.js</a>, I found the task more approachable than I had before.</p>
<p>So I may as well go ahead and announce the start of &quot;GoKibitz&quot;:<a href="http://gokibitz.com">http://gokibitz.com</a>, which is beginning life as an SGF viewer, but will hopefully grow to be an editor and more. I&#39;ve got a very basic demo up, which you can view below. It only really works in Chrome right now. I have no intention of supporting older browsers, but it will eventually work correctly in Firefox and other modern browsers.</p>
<p>It&#39;s got some animation, which shows a bit of the direction I want to take the renderer, but the renderer itself is pretty half-baked right now. The logic for rendering is separate from everything else, and it&#39;s the part I&#39;ve spent the least time on. (I just wanted to create something to actually see stones to help keep myself motivated.) I&#39;m probably going to move to something like &quot;Paper JS&quot;:<a href="http://paperjs.org/">http://paperjs.org/</a> for rendering so that I can do more creative things with how the board, stones, and animations look. My dream is to have GoKibitz feel a little bit more like games from &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot;:<a href="http://www.hulu.com/hikaru-no-go">http://www.hulu.com/hikaru-no-go</a>, which used glowing stones, dramatic perspectives, and lots of other techniques to convey the drama of a game of go.</p>
<p>And, of course, at some point I&#39;ll have to figure out how I want to enable per-move commenting. Do hook into a service like Disqus? Do I create my own API, powered by my own DB? Obviously there&#39;s tons of work left to be done. As the proud father of a nearly one-year-old boy, I don&#39;t have tons of time, either. But I&#39;m enjoying myself so far, and I think that there are a decent amount of people who&#39;d really appreciate a more dynamic way of showing and interacting with go games.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the demo (&quot;direct link&quot;:<a href="http://gokibitz.com/demos/2013-06-15/">http://gokibitz.com/demos/2013-06-15/</a>) and, if you&#39;re code-inclined, feel free to check out &quot;the source&quot;:<a href="https://github.com/neagle/gokibitz/tree/master/src/js">https://github.com/neagle/gokibitz/tree/master/src/js</a>.
