Hopefully, I&#39;ll find a chance to come back to this and actually build what I want. If I do, I&#39;ll update the post.</p>
<p>I love using GNU Screen to manage my workflow on projects. If you work entirely in the terminal, it&#39;s great to have screens open with the different processes and files you need to juggle while working on something.</p>
<p>For example, I might have these screens going simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li>A grunt watch process</li>
<li>Gruntfile.js</li>
<li>My main plugin JS file</li>
<li>My main plugin SCSS file</li>
<li>A command line for compiling Grunt, maneuvering files around, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside screen, the shortcut @Ctrl+A, &quot;@ brings up a list of open screens. Inside any individual screen, you can change the name with @Ctrl+A, A@. This is a great window-management feature that doesn&#39;t rely on any OS Chrome, but it has a further advantage when you&#39;re working remotely. Any time you get disconnected because you got up for lunch or, I don&#39;t know, you stopped working for a while out of the desire to sleep during the dark period of the earth&#39;s rotation, you can log back in and just @screen -r@ to hop back in exactly where you left off, all of your screens and processes just as you left them.</p>
<p>You can also name your screen sessions with @screen -S name@, then disconnect and reconnect to them according to what you&#39;re working on.</p>
<p>The process of setting up your project initially is still a bit of a pain, and it&#39;s especially a pain on your Mac, where you lose any active screen sessions whenever the Mac gets restarted. Since my whole life as a developer is structured around Grunt projects, I&#39;d love to have an automatic startup for screen that takes advantage of this predictable structure.</p>
<p>So my wishlist item:</p>
<h1 id="i-go-to-the-root-directory-of-a-grunt-project-">I go to the root directory of a Grunt project.</h1>
<h1 id="i-type-grunt-screen-or-screen-or-whatever-">I type &quot;grunt screen&quot; (or @screen@, or whatever).</h1>
<h1 id="grunt-or-my-startup-script-or-whatever-checks-to-see-if-i-m-in-a-screen-session-already-if-i-am-it-aborts-with-a-nice-message-">Grunt, or my startup script, or whatever checks to see if I&#39;m in a screen session already. If I am, it aborts with a nice message.</h1>
<h1 id="then-it-checks-to-see-if-there-s-an-active-screen-session-for-this-project-">Then it checks to see if there&#39;s an active screen session for this project.</h1>
<h1 id="if-there-is-it-resumes-it-">If there is, it resumes it.</h1>
<h1 id="if-not-it-starts-a-new-one-">If not, it starts a new one.</h1>
<h1 id="it-also-spins-up-some-default-screens-one-for-a-grunt-watch-process-and-a-few-others-based-on-my-gruntfile-js-there-could-be-logic-to-figure-out-what-some-key-files-are-or-there-could-just-be-a-section-of-the-config-where-important-files-are-listed-explicitly-">It also spins up some default screens - one for a grunt watch process, and a few others based on my Gruntfile.js. There could be logic to figure out what some key files are, or there could just be a section of the config where important files are listed explicitly.</h1>
<h1 id="if-i-m-not-inside-a-grunt-project-screen-starts-as-normal-">If I&#39;m not inside a Grunt project, screen starts as normal.</h1>
