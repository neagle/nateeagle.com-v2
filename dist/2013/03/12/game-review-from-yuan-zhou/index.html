I&#39;ve played go for just over three years and despite my many character flaws have managed to make some progress. Last week, I decided to take more detailed notes than normal in an attempt to help the instruction sink in more deeply. It was also a chance to try to preserve some of the sayings and general advice that comes up in lessons - it&#39;s one of my favorite things about Shifu&#39;s style.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
