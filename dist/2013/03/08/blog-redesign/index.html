<p>h2. We&#39;re responsive!</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to note that back in 2006, I read a post by some guy about some JavaScript he wrote that would change the body class based on the width of the browser window. He had a demo that showed a web page adjusting the number of columns in its layout based on the window size. I bookmarked it and briefly tried to create a design for my blog based around that idea, but then I probably got bored and watched some Simpsons episodes.</p>
<p>Seven years later, responsive design has taken over the internet. To be fair, it matters a lot more now that we&#39;re using tons of mobile devices. But it&#39;s interesting to remember that lots of things don&#39;t take off when they become possible, they take off when they matter.</p>
<p>h2. @font-face</p>
<p>We&#39;re rocking custom fonts, just like the rest of the internet.</p>
<p>h2. Grunt JS</p>
<p>I&#39;m using Grunt to automate everything I can. It compiles my scss, minifies my js, runs jekyll, and irons my laundry.</p>
<p>h2. No longer served by Github Pages</p>
<p>I thought it was fun to use Github&#39;s pages to host my site last time. Then I realized that it didn&#39;t really matter because I&#39;m paying for a VPS anyway. Also I&#39;m doing all my compilation on my own with Grunt, so the fact that Github will run a Jekyll process on its side wasn&#39;t really a perk anymore.</p>
<p>It is, of course, still _on_ Github. You can check out &quot;the repo&quot;:<a href="https://github.com/neagle/nateeagle.com">https://github.com/neagle/nateeagle.com</a> if you feel like it.</p>
<p>h2. And actual posts, maybe</p>
<p>But no promises.</p>
