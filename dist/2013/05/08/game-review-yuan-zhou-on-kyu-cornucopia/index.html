These are games that we play in the afternoon during the monthly group go lessons. They&#39;re tournament-style games, with 45 minutes on the clock for each player, and they&#39;re handicapped according to our class <a href="http://xyzgoclub.com">ladder</a>.</p>
<p>After all the games our finished, he reviews each one, which is a fantastic way to learn. Not only to I get to hear detailed feedback on my own moves and the moves of other players of similar ability, I get to ask questions immediately about points I don&#39;t understand or other possibilities about which I&#39;m curious.</p>
<p>This particular game was against a player who is ahead of me on the ladder and against whom I was one and one, though with a reverse komi each time. (Instead of adding handicap stones, we award reverse komis so that the game flows more like an even game.) I don&#39;t find his style to be intimidating, but he has a way of whittling away at me with more accurate reading. This game I fell behind due to too-typical mistakes, but was able to come back later by cutting off one of his groups.</p>
<p>I hope you&#39;ll enjoy my teacher&#39;s comments; big thanks to Bill Cobb and Myron Souris for creating the game record. In the game record, the players are anonymized, but I hereby confess to playing black.</p>
