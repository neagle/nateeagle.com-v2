This year, he had attendees play remote games against his students via KGS. They played in front of physical boards and Shifu (Yuan) played their moves for us on KGS, then played our moves for them on the boards. I suspect that the process was more laborious than Shifu anticipated, because the games ended up taking a long time, despite having standard time settings of 45 minutes per side with five byo-yomi periods of 30 seconds each.</p>
<p>I played someone I hadn&#39;t met, but my opponent was white and Shifu said it was a no-komi game, which means white should be about a stone stronger than me. And, indeed, it turned out to be a grueling, difficult game that lasted over four hours. The yose (end game) was extremely close, but I think I was a little bit behind. Fortunately, white missed a weakness at the very end and I was able to capture a group, prompting white&#39;s resignation. Still, I was frustrated because my judgment and counting turned out to be wrong. Earlier in the game, I thought black was in a better position than it actually was, and even at the end of the game, when I realized things were very close, I thought black had a slight lead.</p>
