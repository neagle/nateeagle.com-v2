I sniff air through my nostrils like a bull.
I place a stone next to the white invader
and the print of my finger glistens wetly.
&quot;That&#39;s why they make the weaker player
play black in handicap games,&quot;
someone once joked. &quot;So you can see them sweat.&quot;
My opponent, who has been running his fingers
through the stones in his bowl, making them
clack, immediately places another stone next to mine.
&quot;That was,&quot; he says slowly, &quot;Not correct.&quot;
I clench my teeth and wonder
how much the sudden flush to my neck and ears shows.
I was given nine stones, a nine-stone head start.
Nine stones scattered over a whole board
as if I owned it all already.
Nine stones, marking each of the star points
a sign that your opponent can give you
everything
because you know how to keep nothing.
I look at the now-cut-off cluster of black stones -
a broken dragon, a clump of bones and flesh
tangled and ugly
and now dead, dead, dead -
and try to judge whether I&#39;m so behind
that the polite thing would be to resign.
But I can&#39;t tell.
So, I decide
to struggle.</p>
