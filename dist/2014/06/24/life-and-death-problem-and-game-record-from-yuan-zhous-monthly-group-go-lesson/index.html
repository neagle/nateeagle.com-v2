We have a lot of time to try to solve it: it&#39;s embarrassing how infrequently I manage to do so correctly. Even this month, with an easier-than-usual problem, I failed to get 100% of the correct result. The challenge is always to tell Shifu &quot;what is the best result?&quot;, not simply to find a way to achieve a stated outcome. Frequently, the best result is not simply life or death.</p>

<p>(Note: Eidogo&#39;s problem interface is not the best. Soon I&#39;ll use GoKibitz to do this, and it&#39;ll work the way I want, damn it. SOON!)</p>

<p>After several months away, my nemesis Nathan returned, who is now officially 1d AGA! It&#39;s some slight consolation for the fact that I&#39;ve fallen behind him in our head-to-head record. This month, true to form, we had an exciting game. The game record has full commentary by Shifu Yuan Zhou, which comes courtesy of <a href="http://usgo.org">the AGA</a>, who paid for it, and Bill Cobb, who provides the significant work of transcribing and crafting a written record from a complex, in-person back and forth that he records on a video camera. I&#39;m very grateful to Bill for that service; it&#39;s no small luxury to have such a high-quality version of a strong player&#39;s analysis of my games.</p>
<p>I played black.</p>

<p>It was a heart-breaking result to lose after working so hard to put myself in a winning position, but Nathan&#39;s ability to struggle and make chances for himself is no joke. As always, my judgment is a little stronger than my reading accuracy, which makes reading--especially under time pressure--a painful weakness.</p>
