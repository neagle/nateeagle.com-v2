<p>I&#39;ve been getting a lot done on GoKibitz (goKibitz? gokibitz? Go Kibitz?) recently. You can see a preview of the move commenting feature above. That&#39;s the whole reason I started doing this, really -- I wanted to be able to have comments and discussions on individual moves in game records. There&#39;s still tons of work to be done in terms of design (I&#39;m using unmodified Bootstrap right now), but I&#39;m pretty encouraged to have a working prototype.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/waltheri/wgo.js">WGo</a> is also getting prettier. Jan Prokop, WGo&#39;s creator, <a href="https://github.com/waltheri/wgo.js/commit/d2e6d62618f191459f0f9a401b18078b2fd0e664">just added</a> blurred shadows and improved stone rendering (including beautiful clamshell lines for white stones), and I <a href="https://github.com/waltheri/wgo.js/commit/8c2b478586229ede9b6d4a7fd909c0b8c6350355">added in</a> resolution-doubling for Retina displays, so it doesn&#39;t look fuzzy anymore on my Macbook.</p>
<p>I&#39;m learning tons about <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> as I do this, and I&#39;m happy to say I&#39;m getting to the point where it&#39;s at least as fun as it is consternating. Making my first custom directive, especially, was as satisfying as my first jQuery plugin.</p>
<p>But progress continues: it feels good to have five weeks of productivity going on this. It feels like it&#39;s getting easier, the longer the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">chain</a> gets.</p>
