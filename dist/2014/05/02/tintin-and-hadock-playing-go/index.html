It has a lot of game records from high-profile go matches, none of which I&#39;ve ever opened, but it also has tons of go-related images from around the web. It doesn&#39;t tend to have image sources, which is a shame, but the images themselves are great. Recently, they posted an image of page from <em>Tintin in Tibet</em> showing Tintin and Haddock playing go.</p>

<p>My wife is a huge Tintin fan and owns most of the books, so I&#39;ve read them all at one point or another, too. I was pretty thrilled to discover that there was a go reference in <em>Tintin in Tibet</em> (my wife&#39;s favorite). Sadly, she quickly pulled out the book and showed me what the original panel looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tintin-au-tibet.jpg" class="l-full" style="max-width: 576px;" alt="Tintin and Haddock Playing... Chess!"></p>
<p>Chess?!</p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty embarrassing that I was so easily fooled (especially since the go version has the text in Comic Sans), but I guess it shows that one is always ready to believe what one wants to believe.</p>
<p>But the reworked fan image is great, and I love the internal monologue the creator gave Haddock as he ponders the game&#39;s position.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a quick English translation, since the French is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But how could I get myself in such shit! And at six stones! Here, this is fucking... if I attack his moyo, I don&#39;t make any points and he&#39;ll chase me and I&#39;m cooked, for sure!</p>
<p>This shape, here, is it solid? And if I play here first, what does that do? I play there, he plays there, here... yeah, that seems good. Protect the san-san? It&#39;s not very active... I have to play globally! Then here, along the side, but the third or the fourth line? Hm... and it&#39;s not very sente. Playing there is for the end game, too small... here?</p>
<p>...the cut there... hm, I have this threat to net here, and if he looks to get out here, I consolidate my position and make an enormous territory on this side and afterwards I can attack this damn moyo! Bravo! My dear Tintin, I ask you what will you say to this!</p>
