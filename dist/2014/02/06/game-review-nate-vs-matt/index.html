(All fellow students of my teacher, &quot;Yuan Zhou&quot;:<a href="http://zhouyuan.com">http://zhouyuan.com</a>, are my siblings. Students who preceded me are &quot;older&quot; and students who came after me are &quot;younger&quot;.)</p>
<p>I met Matt at &quot;the 2011 Maryland Open&quot;:<a href="http://www.usgo.org/news/2011/06/ke-huang-7d-wins-2011-maryland-open/">http://www.usgo.org/news/2011/06/ke-huang-7d-wins-2011-maryland-open/</a> over a go board; I was 10k and he was 11k. Matt and I talked after our game and I told him about taking lessons; he became a student himself shortly afterward.</p>
<p>I&#39;m proud of the progress I&#39;ve made since 2011, but Matt proved in this game that he&#39;s made dramatic progress, too. This was a no-komi game where I played white.</p>
<p>Both Matt and I went over this game with Shifu (Yuan Zhou) in our individual lessons. These comments are my attempt to preserve some of the things that came out of my lesson.</p>
<p>Every time there is a statement in quotation marks, I am quoting Shifu.</p>
<p>(These opening and closing remarks are reproduced in the game record so that it makes sense independent of this post.)</p>

<p>Some takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Correct judgment in the opening is very important, particularly when both players are playing calmly and waiting for the appropriate moment to begin fighting. Making a move that doesn&#39;t work well with your other stones can leave you at an immediate disadvantage. That&#39;s one reason some styles emphasize initiating fighting as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sometimes my fighting is too lax, too patient. I had an opportunity early to cleanly kill black&#39;s stones with a peep and a seal, but I didn&#39;t look hard enough for it because I was content to play an obvious but slack move. If I&#39;m going to play for thickness, I need to recognize that when I&#39;ve got my chance, I have to attack as sharply as possible. &quot;When it&#39;s time to shoot, shoot! Don&#39;t talk!&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never help your opponent! My peep in the upper left gave black a key stone. Never assume a forcing move is free. If your opponent is going to win, make sure they win by taking things from you: no presents allowed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Study life and death. Life and death isn&#39;t just an abstract pursuit: if I had handled the top correctly, it would have been game over. My L&amp;D skills are lagging behind the rest of my game right now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tsumego study matters. Because of my tsumego study, I accurately and easily identified one tesuji, but I missed a simple net. Those kinds of nets are maybe 12k level - continuing to do many relatively quick, easy problems will help me avoid mistakes like this. Because of this, I lost another opportunity to win the game.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thickness has value! I made tons of mistakes in this game, but managed to win in the end because playing thick gave me so many opportunities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
