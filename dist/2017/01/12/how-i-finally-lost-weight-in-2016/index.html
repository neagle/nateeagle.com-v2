<p><img src="/images/posts/nate-after.jpg" class="l-full" style="max-width: 1365;" alt="Me in October of 2016 with my family"></p>
<p>The last time I was fit was in the aughts. I was lifting weights regularly on a rack / barbell combo my friend and I bought and kept at my house. I got rid of most sugar, bread, and other flour products in my diet and lost weight; I was somewhere around 180 lbs. My bench press took off during that period. It had always been one of my favorite lifts, and while lifting 2 - 3 times a week, my 1 RM (rep max... the highest weight you can push/pull one time) surged upward. I kept pushing, and kept testing my 1 RM. The last one I successfully lifted was 335 lbs, which is pretty decent. (What&#39;s not so impressive is that I couldn&#39;t <em>squat</em> the same amount.) On the day I tried to lift 340 lbs, I felt something snap and rolled out from under the bar: I had torn over half of my right pectoral tendon away from the muscle. Muscles can grow faster than tendons can adapt. I pushed too hard, too fast.</p>
<p>After that, I had to physical therapy to regain range of motion, and I fell out of regular lifting. My enthusiasm and confidence were gone. My diet didn&#39;t change right away, but the habits started to slip, and that began a long, slow period of progressive weight gain.</p>
<p>The weight gain period isn&#39;t particularly interesting, except to note that I spent most of it <em>trying</em> to lose weight. A lot of the food I ate was healthy: I&#39;d periodically add whey protein shakes back into my diet and focus on salad-bar lunches. But it was periodic, and I&#39;d make plenty of exceptions for food I loved, like burgers. I&#39;d make decisions to focus on weighing myself every day and eating at a caloric deficit, but inevitably the second or third or fourth day would lead to an erasure of any weight I&#39;d lost due to what I&#39;d perceived as a normal day, I&#39;d get frustrated, and abandon the whole thing. I lost any belief that I was capable of changing my diet enough to lose weight.</p>
<p>I spent about ten months when I was at AOL doing a circuit training class two times a week, where we rotated through a set of different exercises, led by a trainer, not resting much in between each station. The idea was to keep your heart rate up the whole time and get a cardio workout in addition to the weightlifting. I left every session drenched and exhausted. I didn&#39;t lose any weight, and it was hard to say if I got any stronger. The trainer periodically measured our body fat percentage using a bioimpedance device, and it showed me making no progress. As a solution, my trainer dispensed juice-cleanse kits. I hope I don&#39;t need to tell you that juice cleanses are bullshit. I had an small argument with him about the fact that toxins don&#39;t exist.</p>
<h2 id="return-to-lifting">Return to Lifting</h2>
<p>In 2016, I started a new job, and I found that one of the developers who worked there went, three times a week, to lift weights at the nearby Gold&#39;s Gym. I checked out the Gold&#39;s, and found that they offered a month-to-month membership, so I signed up and snuck over to start trying to lift. On the second or third outing, my coworker messaged me on Slack when I got back. &quot;How did you like Gold&#39;s?&quot; I was embarrassed he&#39;d spotted me, but he invited me to lift with him, and pretty soon we&#39;d settled into a routine. He was also a believer in emphasizing the core, compound barbell lifts: squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press. We started doing the <a href="http://startingstrength.com/">Starting Strength</a> program by Mark Rippetoe.</p>
<p>The best thing about my coworker was his diligence: it just wasn&#39;t ever a question whether we&#39;d workout. We just did it, rain or shine, whatever else was going on. And I started getting stronger and stronger. My squat and deadlift weights, especially, shot up, even though my bench press was stuck pretty low. (And probably will be forever, due to the pec injury.) I also switched to eating as few carbs as possible. Salads with meat instead of meals with rice, nothing with bread, etc.</p>
<p>I started to notice changes pretty soon, as the muscles in my shoulders and arms got more visible. I started wearing t-shirts by themselves, without always wearing a long-sleeved shirt over them to cover up body parts I felt made me look fat. To some degree, I was &quot;recomping&quot;, or altering the composition of my body as I lost some fat and gained some muscle.</p>
<p>By July, I was strong enough that I tested my 1 RMs for deadlift, squat, and bench press, and managed to total more than 1000 lbs, which is a decent milestone for a man. But though my weight had gone down to 205 for a while when I started lifting, it was back up to 217. I didn&#39;t want to stay strong but fat, so I decided to get serious about cutting, or running a calorie deficit, to reduce the amount of body fat I had.</p>
<p>The general word on cutting is that it&#39;s hard or impossible to gain muscle at the same time, so you usually choose between whether you&#39;re going to get stronger or leaner. There&#39;s some wiggle room there, especially if you still have a lot of body fat, which I did. Everyone has their own goals, and a lot of men think it&#39;s better to keep working on getting bigger and stronger, and stop vainly worrying about abs. For me, though, one of the biggest reasons I wanted to get fit was that my self-consciousness about how I looked without a shirt on had kept me from enjoying activities involving swimming for years. I felt miserable during vacations at the beach and let my wife take our son to swimming lessons on her own.</p>
<h2 id="anti-charity">Anti-Charity</h2>
<p>But how to do it? I was pretty familiar with most of the mechanisms involving losing weight, but putting them all together, getting all the versions of me at every different time of day to sign on to the same program, had proved impossible time after time after time. I decided to try something serious: I signed on to <a href="https://www.stickk.com">stickk.com</a> and created a weight-loss committment that came with a serious threat. If I didn&#39;t meet my weekly goal, it would donate $10 of real money--my money--to a SuperPAC that supported the candidate I did not want to become President. (I won&#39;t alienate any of you by specifying which candidate that was, so let&#39;s just say that their name rhymed with Ronald Grump.)</p>
<p>The idea of anti-charity motivation is that the thought of your money being used for something abhorrent to you can be a more powerful motivator than other incentives. And, for me, it really worked. I knew that having my money donated to the SuperPAC was <em>not</em> an option, so I got serious. I already knew the main thing I had to do, which was eliminate eating <em>after</em> supper in the evenings. My breakfasts and lunches were already pretty locked down, but I&#39;d always get a surge of calories later in the day, when I got hungry after 9 pm.</p>
<p>The first week went well, and then the really lucky thing happened: I went away for a week to <a href="http://www.gocongress.org/">Go Congress</a> in Boston. It was a week of tournament play, workshops, and other go activities, and I left my family at home. I lived in a dorm on campus, had a meal plan, and had the most success I&#39;ve ever had at sticking to a diet. I ate vegetables and proteins for each and every meal, controlled my portions, and because I was constantly thinking about go during the day, never thought about being hungry.</p>
<p>I also discovered a benefit to the anti-charity goal that I hadn&#39;t anticipated. It&#39;s hard, when you&#39;re eating a bunch of salads around other people, to avoid having one&#39;s choices noticed and commented on. Nobody means to be mean about it, but it comes up, and then you end up having to defend why you&#39;re trying to lose weight, and it&#39;s awkward. But I found that if I just briefly told people that I was losing weight because I sure as hell wasn&#39;t going to donate money to Ronald Grump, their reaction changed from &quot;you don&#39;t need to lose weight&quot; to &quot;um, I think you&#39;ve had enough tomatoes.&quot; And that was great.</p>
<h2 id="consistency">Consistency</h2>
<p>In a way, that&#39;s the end of the story. When you maintain a consistent caloric deficit over a long period of time, your weight slowly goes down. I&#39;ve maintained a lot of my strength, though I haven&#39;t <em>gained</em> much, either. I went down, pound by pound, over the course of months, and I gradually saw fat disappear and get replaced by visible muscles and veins. And that felt great.</p>
<p>What that doesn&#39;t tell you, of course, is what it&#39;s like during that period. It <em>doesn&#39;t</em> involve feeling hungry all the time, though it definitely involved learning to feel a little hungry <em>some</em> of the time. I had to learn to lean in to the feeling of being a little hungry when I went to sleep. If I didn&#39;t feel a little hungry, I usually hadn&#39;t run a deficit, and I had to eat a little less the following day. But eating a 100-calorie snack before bed was often useful, and going to bed <em>too</em> hungry wasn&#39;t smart, because famished-Nate would wake up during the night and eat something, diet be damned.</p>
<p>Mostly, my habits did the work of food selection for me. That, and Blue Apron. We started doing two-person Blue Apron meals, which were shockingly tasty, and reasonably portioned. If there wasn&#39;t enough food to have leftovers, I didn&#39;t overeat. But if there _is_ enough food for leftovers, I&#39;m kinda screwed, because it&#39;s very hard for me to stop eating something delicious while there&#39;s still a bunch in a dish in the middle of the table.</p>
<p>I also, of course, <em>constantly</em> thought about food, exercise, fitness, and my own body. And while that&#39;s not exactly misery, it takes a ton of mental energy and attention. I started reading a lot of <a href="https://reddit.com/r/fitness">/r/fitness</a>, and did a lot of other reading on weightlifting. I had to keep my mind busy, thinking about my goals, learning more about eating and lifting. It&#39;s not trivial to lose weight. Even though the principles are relatively simple, the sustained focus it requires isn&#39;t.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>So here are some takeaways, mostly for my own benefit.</p>
<h3 id="you-don-t-have-to-do-cardio-to-lose-weight-">You don&#39;t have to do cardio to lose weight.</h3>
<p>I hate extended cardio. I&#39;m not saying you have to hate cardio, or that it&#39;s not beneficial. But it&#39;s not really the best thing for losing weight, since it doesn&#39;t really burn that many calories. All I do is five minutes of walking at 4 MPH at an incline (10 - 14%) before I work out, mostly to get my body temperature up. Cardio can have all sorts of benefits, but if it&#39;s one of the main ways you&#39;re trying to create a calorie deficit, I think it&#39;s dangerous. Because it&#39;s exhausting, and if you don&#39;t <em>like</em> it, and you eventually stop doing it as much or as intensely, your weight loss will stop.</p>
<h3 id="you-cannot-depend-on-willpower-">You cannot depend on willpower.</h3>
<p>You don&#39;t lose weight by using your willpower. Our willpower sucks. We have a limited supply of it, and if you use it on not eating, even if you&#39;re successful on a given day, you won&#39;t have it for other important things like not swearing at an annoying coworker. You lose weight by creating structure and establishing habits. You eat the same thing a lot, because you know how many calories it has and you know you like it. You know you&#39;re eating a salad with meat for lunch every day. You pay enough that it&#39;s a good, satisfying meal. You have the same whey protein shake for breakfast every day, because you never have to think about it.</p>
<p>And you don&#39;t get too depressed over the parties, holidays, and inevitable breaches in discipline, because the next day you get back to the routine.</p>
<h3 id="accept-that-progress-will-never-feel-fast-or-inevitable-while-it-s-happening">Accept that progress will never feel fast or inevitable while it&#39;s happening</h3>
<p>Looking back, the months from July to December look like one steady, happy march toward success. But they almost never felt that way. I frequently felt on the verge of failure, or as if the progress I made was worthless since I still thought I looked horrible. I always felt so far from where I wanted to be. Those are stupid feelings, but they&#39;re feelings that I never really got rid of, as much as I was able to understand that you don&#39;t get to a goal without going through the intermediary steps.</p>
<p>But focusing on the rewards along the way helped a little bit. I got to buy new jeans as my waist size decreased. I bought new shirts in size large, then size medium. And I read Reddit Fitness a lot, because it had a bunch of people angstily and vainly worrying about their own weight, muscles, and progress just like I was, and it helped me feel better.</p>
<h3 id="bioimpedence-sucks">Bioimpedence sucks</h3>
<p>Oh, I mentioned a bioimpedence device a little while ago. That&#39;s a device, either handheld or a scale you stand on, that sends an electrical current through your body to measure body fat. Since body fat has different electrical resistance than other tissue, you can apply an algorithm to the current and estimate some stats about body composition. My bioimpedance scale told me I was about 28% BF when I started cutting in July. I was down to 22% around Thanksgiving, when I was talking with my lifting partner about what my target weight was. He told me my scale was absurd and that my BF% was lower than it indicated, and that my target weight should therefore be <em>higher</em> than what I was saying.</p>
<p>To settle the bet, I paid a bunch of money to do a <a href="https://breakingmuscle.com/learn/the-scale-lies-why-the-dexa-scan-is-best">DEXA scan</a>, which is basically an X-Ray that gives much more accurate data about body composition. It found that my overall BF% was 15%, which was radically lower than my scale said. The technician didn&#39;t really give me a great answer as to why my scale might be so off, but let that just be a warning to you: that level of inaccuracy might lead you to set radically incorrect goals for yourself. For me, it had me thinking I needed to target a weight around 165 lbs ultimately. The DEXA scan said I had 165 lbs of lean body mass, which means aiming for that weight would put me at 0% BF, which would have me be dead. Now I now that something between 175 - 180% will be <em>very</em> lean, and that I definitely shouldn&#39;t try for anything lower.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Losing weight requires living counter-culturally. It takes time and money and structure and energy. But it is possible! If you&#39;re trying to lose weight, I hope some of the things I learned can help you.</p>
