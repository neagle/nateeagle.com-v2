<p>It is fortunate that the satisfaction of go<br>is not reliant on victory.<br>How horrible and how vain<br>if only half of go were glorious<br>as if only the rich and comfortable<br>and powerful and triumphant<br>could call their lives lived.<br>It is better that when a go game<br>is left soaked in blood<br>or tangled in novel intricacies,<br>with every twist speaking its own<br>furious desire to fight<br>or delicate preservation of balance,<br>the landscape that it leaves,<br>unique and ephemeral,<br>affirms the deep worth<br>of white and black together.  </p>
<p>It is easiest to imagine peace in death<br>if it came during a game of go.<br>How effortless to say,<br>in standing up at last,<br>that this life was lived well.</p>
