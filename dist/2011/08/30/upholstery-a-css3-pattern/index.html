I really dug it when I saw it a few months ago. There are some nice patterns in there (&quot;carbon&quot;:<a href="http://leaverou.me/css3patterns/#carbon">http://leaverou.me/css3patterns/#carbon</a> &amp; &quot;Japanese cube&quot;:<a href="http://leaverou.me/css3patterns/#japanese-cube">http://leaverou.me/css3patterns/#japanese-cube</a> are my favorites) and I love generating graphics with code. CSS gradient syntax made my brain hurt, though, and the first time I tried creating a pattern of my own, I wasn&#39;t very successful.</p>

<p>When I used CSS gradients, I tended to &quot;generate&quot;:<a href="http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/">http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/</a> them. That worked okay, but the problem with a tool like that is that it can leave you forever dependent on UI elements and tedious fiddling to get the effect you want. CSS syntax shouldn&#39;t be so difficult that it requires a separate tool: the syntax is just a tool itself, after all, intended to make it easy to work with browser code more complicated than anything I&#39;ll ever write.</p>
<p>So: we&#39;ve started up a new tradition at AOL for front-end developers called the FED Challenge. It&#39;s a biweekly contest that&#39;s supposed to encourage developers to try out new techniques and technologies they might not already know about, or to try their hand at something they&#39;re less familiar with. I decided to make the second FED challenge creating a CSS3 Pattern ala the examples in Verou&#39;s gallery, which gave me a chance to finally get past my gradient brain pain.</p>
<p>I&#39;m happy to report that it didn&#39;t take very long. Luckily for all of us, Webkit has &quot;changed its gradient syntax&quot;:<a href="http://www.webkit.org/blog/1424/css3-gradients/">http://www.webkit.org/blog/1424/css3-gradients/</a> to match Mozilla&#39;s (clearly superior) syntax. And once I got an example in place in jsFiddle and started to play for a sustained amount of time, all the properties seemed to sort themselves out. (Play is, of course, one of the very best ways to internalize something you don&#39;t know.)</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&#39;s my submission:</p>
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 630px" src="http://jsfiddle.net/nate/37rxC/embedded/result,css,html,js"></iframe>

<p>I was messing around with radial gradients and got the idea that they could be used to create the puffiness of upholstery as well as the shadowed dimples of the buttons. I think it turned out pretty nice.</p>
<p>Check out the CSS in the tab up above for a highly-formatted, commented version of the CSS, which I find helpful when trying to look through someone else&#39;s styles.</p>
<p>If you prefer, however, here is the simplest, streamlined, non-vendor-prefixed version of the CSS:</p>
<p>{% highlight css %}
background:
radial-gradient(hsl(0, 100%, 27%) 4%, hsl(0, 100%, 18%) 9%, hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0) 9%) 0 0,
radial-gradient(hsl(0, 100%, 27%) 4%, hsl(0, 100%, 18%) 8%, hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0) 10%) 50px 50px,
radial-gradient(hsla(0, 100%, 30%, 0.8) 20%, hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0)) 50px 0,
radial-gradient(hsla(0, 100%, 30%, 0.8) 20%, hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0)) 0 50px,
radial-gradient(hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 1) 35%, hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0) 60%) 50px 0,
radial-gradient(hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 1) 35%, hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0) 60%) 100px 50px,
radial-gradient(hsla(0, 100%, 15%, 0.7), hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0)) 0 0,
radial-gradient(hsla(0, 100%, 15%, 0.7), hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0)) 50px 50px,
linear-gradient(45deg, hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0) 49%, hsla(0, 100%, 0%, 1) 50%, hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0) 70%) 0 0,
linear-gradient(-45deg, hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0) 49%, hsla(0, 100%, 0%, 1) 50%, hsla(0, 100%, 20%, 0) 70%) 0 0;
background-color: #300;
background-size: 100px 100px;
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>I decided to submit the example to Verou after the contest, and she was kind enough to &quot;add it to the gallery&quot;:<a href="http://leaverou.me/css3patterns/#upholstery">http://leaverou.me/css3patterns/#upholstery</a>.</p>
