Think of it as a way to build a blog that allows for some dynamic templating but is entirely driven by files. Quick tangent: if you build sites for a living but find yourself kind of exhausted with big, feature-rich CMSs by the time you come home, Jekyll just might be what it takes to make blogging for yourself fun again.</p>
<p>To the main point: Jekyll&#39;s &quot;documentation boldly proclaims this&quot;:<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/liquid-extensions">https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/liquid-extensions</a> about its includes:</p>
<p>bq.. If you have small page fragments that you wish to include in multiple places on your site, you can use the @include@ tag.</p>
<p>@{{ site.lcb }}% include sig.textile %{{ site.rcb }}@</p>
<p>Jekyll expects all include files to be placed in an @_includes@ directory at the root of your source dir. So this will embed the contents of @/path/to/proto/site/_includes/sig.textile@ into the calling file.</p>
<p>p. This might lead you to believe that Jekyll will parse Textile formatting in your included file (or Markdown formatting, for you infidels). <em>But you would be mistaken</em>. Jekyll will do no such thing: it will blithely output anything you toss into that optimistically named @.textile@ or @.markdown@ file as unparsed text.</p>
<p>It looks like I&#39;m not the only one with this problem: &quot;one&quot;:<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jekyll-rb/browse_thread/thread/216db15546e79073">http://groups.google.com/group/jekyll-rb/browse_thread/thread/216db15546e79073</a>, &quot;two&quot;:<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/164">https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/164</a>.</p>
<p>For the moment, the only solution is to abandon our futile dreams of parsed includes and use straight html. But let&#39;s see if we can at least get the documentation changed.</p>
